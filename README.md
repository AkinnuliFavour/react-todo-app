# react-todo-app
A todo-app made with react and tailwind css.
This app is a practice app to demonstrate my mewly learnt skill in react and tailwind.
This project is open to corrections if you think there are changes to be made to improve the app and my understanding.
It should be noted that JSON server was used for storing app data.
Run:
npm install -g json-server, then,
json-server --w data/db.json --p 3500 to get access to app data
